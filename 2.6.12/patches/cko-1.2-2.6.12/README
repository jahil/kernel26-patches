NAME
cko - colored kernel output patch for Linux kernel of 2.4 and 2.6 series

DESCRIPTION
cko is a patch for Linux kernel of 2.4 and 2.6 series which will make
colored kernel messages in BSD style.

OPTIONS
If you don't like default yellow color in cko patch you can change it to
color you like in menuconfig with option "Colored Kernel Output" under
menu "Character devices" or "Device Drivers/Character devices" in case
of 2.6 kernels.

Here is a an example of colors and it's codes.
The numbers are the attribute codes used by the video card in hexadecimal:
the most significant bit is the background and the least significant bit is
the foreground.
 0 = black
 1 = blue
 2 = green
 3 = cyan
 4 = red
 5 = purple
 6 = yellow/brown
 7 = white
 8 = grey
 9 = bright blue
 a = bright green
 b = bright cyan
 c = bright red
 d = bright purple
 e = bright yellow
 f = bright white

REQUIREMENTS
In case of 2.4.x kernels, one should say Y to CONFIG_FB_VGA16 option in order
to select additional 8 colors (bright colors).
CONFIG_FB_VGA16 option depends on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL (Prompt for development
and/or incomplete code/drivers) and CONFIG_FB (Support for frame buffer
devices) options.

In case of 2.6.x kernels, one should say Y to CONFIG_FB_VGA16 and
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE in order to select additional 8 colors (bright
colors).
CONFIG_FB_VGA16 and CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE depends on CONFIG_FB (Support
for frame buffer devices).

The reason for such requirements comes from fact that current Linux console
implementation cannot handle 512-byte fonts and bright colors (base 8 colors
with added 0x80) unless framebuffer is used.

BUGS
Current version of cko does not contain known bugs.
