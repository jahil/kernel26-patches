Kernel 2.6.xx Patches and Patchsets Collection
==============================================

I was archiving kernel patches from 2.6.11 release. Most of patches and patchsets projects are dead or added into mainline.
It is also worth noting that some patchsets are built on the back of other patchsets (which may or may not be reflected in the title of the patch).
