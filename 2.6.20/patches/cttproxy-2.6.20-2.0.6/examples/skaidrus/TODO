- The is_local_address check should really be implemented by trying
  to bind to the given address (like in determine_source_address),
  and then checking if the source address that would be used to
  connect to this destination is the same address as the destination
  itself.
                                                                                
- Implement a way of preventing connections for being transproxied.
  This would for example be useful if you have hosts on an internal
  (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8) network that want to connect to the outside
  world -- in such a case, not doing transproxying is akin to using
  MASQUERADE.
