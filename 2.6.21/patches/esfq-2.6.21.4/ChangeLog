2007-06-09      * Factored common code out of esfq_init() and esfq_change().
                * Fixed Kconfig to depend on NF_CONNTRACK instead of
                  NF_CONNTRACK_ENABLED.
                * Made minor cosmetic changes to (hopefully) adhere to kernel
                  standards.
                * Removed all traces of obsolete direct hashing.
                * Returned "divisor" maximum to 14; I can't reproduce the
                  problems I had had earlier.
                * Added ctnatchg hash type (thanks to Ben Pfountz).
                * Fixed and updated README.

2007-05-20      * Removed dst_direct, src_direct, and fwmark_direct hash
                  types.
                * Rewrote esfq_change() so it works.
                * Separated code out of a few functions for usage in
                  esfq_change().
                * ESFQ now depends on NF_CONNTRACK_ENABLED.
                * Updated README.

2007-02-15      * Fixed compilation for 2.6.20.
                * Isolated hash-able variables into their own struct.
                * Instead of considering only the final 32 bits of an IPv4
                  address, use jhash to hash all 128 bits into a single u32.
                * For classic hash type, find the hashes of source,
                  destination, and protocol/port all at once, rather than
                  XOR-ing source and protocol/port before hashing.
                * Added ctorigdst, ctorigsrc, ctrepldst, and ctreplsrc hash
                  types.
                * Deprecated dst_direct, src_direct, and fwmark_direct hash
                  types.
                * Fixed silly gcc "suggest parentheses" warnings.
                * Fixed incorrect depth maximum on 64-bit.
                * Keep track of backlog (sync to a recent sch_sfq.c change).
                * Cleaned up Kconfig description.
                * Updated and fixed README. 
                * Added problem/solution section to the README.

2006-01-30      * Added BUGS section to the README.
                * Made tc only accept divisor <14 instead of <15.
                * Fixed kernel panic when qdisc creation fails (thanks to
                  Alex).
                * Synced with most recent sch_sfq.c change.
                * Updated README.
