*KTAU Distribution*
*******************
	The KTAU distribution is currently ported to and supported on i386, x86_64, ppc 
	(on Blue Gene/L as part of ZeptoOS)  and mips (on SiCortex) architectures. 
	Efforts are under way to port it to the Blue Gene/P ZeptoOS distribution, 
	ppc64 and ia64 as well. Current development is focused on the 2.6.x kernels.
	For more information about KTAU, its feature-set and sample screen-shots, please 
	see http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/ktau/.

	The source tree is organized as per the following hierarchy:

	ktau/patches/		: Contains patches for various versions of Linux kernel
	     src/		: Contains extension to Linux kernel which is independent
				  from version of the kernel.
             user-src/		: Contains user-space libraries and utilities.
	     ktau_installation.log : shows a screenshot of installation step. 
	     LICENCE		: KTAU license file.
	     COPYRIGHT		: KTAU copy right file.	
		
********************
*Installation Steps*
********************
	1. Obtain a KTAU distribution.

 	2. Obtain a vanilla Linux kernel.

	3. To install the kernel extension, in ktau/src/linux-2.x/, run

		sh INSTALL-kernel.sh <path of kernel source> <KTAU patch name>

	    This script will patch the kernel source with the specified patch name, and
	    Then install the KTAU extension to Linux kernel.

	4. To install libraries and utilities, in ktau/user-src/src, run 
	
		make clean all install KERNEL_SRC=<path to kernel source>

	    This will build and put all the libraries and utilities in ktau/user-src/bin,
	    which must be included in $PATH variable. 

	5. At kernel source root, run make menuconfig and configure the kernel.
	   Configure KTAU as discussed the KTAU documentation
           (http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/ktau/) 	

	6. Compile and build the kernel as usual. At kernel root, run
		make clean dep bzImage modules modules_install 	(for Linux-2.4 - no longer supported)
	or 	make clean bzImage modules modules_install	(for Linux-2.6)

	7. Install kernel image (bzImage for ix86) and configure the bootloader (i.e. lilo,
	    grub) to choose the installed kernel image.
	
	8. If you have enabled KTAU_BOOTOPT in the kernel config, then these options can 
	    be passed to kernel cmdline:
		ktau_syscall		: for system calls
		ktau_irq		: for hard irqs
		ktau_bh			: for bottom halves
		ktau_sched		: for scheduling related
		ktau_exception		: for exceptions (e.g. page_faults)
		ktau_socket		: for socket related
		ktau_tcp		: for tcp
		ktau_icmp		: for icmp
		ktau_trace		: for enabling tracing (provided KTAU_TRACING enabled in config).

	9. Also to get the best accuracy wrt timing, use the idle=poll cmdline option where available and
	    disable cpu-freq scaling.
