This is an example application for tproxy v2, called skaidrus.  It listens
on TCP port 9841, and all connections that are redirected to that port (using
the '-j REDIRECT --to-ports 9841' iptables construct) are transproxied to
their original destination.

The code is covered under the LGPL so feel free to include this in your
own application.
